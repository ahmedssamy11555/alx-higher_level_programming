# 0x02. Python - import & modules

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about how to handle standard input and output and how to combine commands and filters with redirections in **python**.

## Technologies

- Python Scripts written in python version 3.8.5
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

| `3-print_reversed_list_integer` | function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.                                                      |
| `4-new_in_list`                 | function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C). |
| `5-no_c`                        | function that removes all characters c and C from a string.                                                         |
| `6-print_matrix_integer`        | function that prints a matrix of integers.                                                                          |
| `8-multiple_returns.py`         | function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.                                  |
| `9-max_integer.py`              | function that finds the biggest integer of a list. tuples.                                                          |
| `10-divisible_by_2.py`          | function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.tuples.                                                            |
| `11-delete_at.py`               | function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.tuples.                                             |
| `12-switch.py`                  | Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b                                                        |
