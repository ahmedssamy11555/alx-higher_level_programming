# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about how to handle standard input and output and how to combine commands and filters with redirections in **python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts written in python version 3.8.5
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Files
All of the following files are pyhon executable files:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-0-positive_or_negative` | This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative. |
| `1-last_digit` | This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number. |
| `2-print_alphabet` | prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.|
| `3-print_alphabt` | prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. |
| `4-print_hexa` |  prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example) |
| `5-print_comb2` |  prints numbers from 0 to 99. |
| `6-print_comb3` |  prints all possible different combinations of two digits. |
| `7-islower` |  function that checks for lowercase character. |
| `8-8-uppercase` |  prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. |
| `9-print_last_digit` |  function that prints the last digit of a number. |
| `10-add` |  function that adds two integers and returns the result. |
| `11-pow` |  function that computes a to the power of b and return the value. |
| `12-fizzbuzz` |  function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space |
| `100-print_tebahpla` |  Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line. |
| `101-remove_char_at` |  function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”). |
| `102-magic_calculation` |  Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:(provided to me) |
